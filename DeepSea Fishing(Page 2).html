    <h2> What is Deep Sea Fishing? </h2>
		<p>
		Deep sea fishing is different from inshore fishing. First of all, the fish are bigger. Seas, gulfs, 
		and oceans provide a much larger habitat for fish to roam, and hunt each other. This means larger fish, 
		but it also requires different techniques and equipment to catch them. The techniques you use to catch 
		bonefish on flats aren’t going to work trying to catch big game species like striped marlin, mahi mahi, 
		or a bluefin tuna.
		</p>
		<p>
		As opposed to inshore or near-shore fishing, deep sea fishing is usually done in waters at least 100 feet deep,
		and as far out as a hundred miles or more from shore. How far offshore you need to go depends on several factors.
		First, what type of fish do you want to catch? Most of the deep sea game fish species are pelagic fish, 
		which means that they live in the pelagic zone of ocean waters – being neither close to the bottom nor 
		near the shore.
		</p>
		<p>
		Some fish species like hanging out on the continental shelf, around deep underwater reefs and seamounts. 
		Other fish species like to hang out past the drop – which is characterized by a steep drop in depth from 
		the continental shelf. In these areas there can be underwater canyons and structures, and different types 
		of fish are found all over. Pelagic fish like to hang out in these deeper waters because there is an abundance 
		of food sources, bait fish – also known as forage— which will migrate from place to place during the year.

		<h2> Different Types of Deep Sea Fishing</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Trolling</li> 
		<li>Bottom Fishing</li>
		<li>Deep Dropping</li>
		<li>Jigging</li>
		<li>Chumming</li>
		<li>Kite Fishing</li>
		<li>Bait Fishing</li>
		<li>Artifical Lure Fishing</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Trolling </h3>
		<p> 
		Trolling is a technique involving dragging baited lines or lures behind a moving boat, 
		allows anglers to cover vast expanses of water effectively. It's ideal for attracting pelagic 
		species like marlin, tuna, yellowtail, sailfish, and albacore, known to roam wide areas in search of prey. 
		The lure's movement and vibration entice these species, making trolling a successful strategy for deep sea fishing.
		</p>
		<h3>Bottom Fishing</h3>
		<p>
		Bottom fishing is a technique where baited hooks are dropped to the ocean floor, primarily 
		targeting bottom-dwelling or demersal species such as rockfish, snapper, grouper, and cod that 
		tend to inhabit reefs, wrecks, or other submerged structures. This strategy provides anglers 
		with accurate depth control, effectively targeting specific habitats these species frequent.
		</p>
		<h3> Casting </h3>
		<p>
		 Jigging, a technique where a weighted lure is dropped vertically and jerked to mimic prey movement, 
		 is effective for attracting a variety of fish species, including amberjack, kingfish, and different 
		 types of tuna. The lure's movement simulates wounded baitfish, triggering the predatory instincts of 
		 species like amberjack and yellowtail, enticing them to strike.
