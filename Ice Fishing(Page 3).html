    <h2> What is Ice Fishing? </h2>
		<p>
		Ice fishing is the practice of catching fish with lines and fish hooks or spears through an opening in the 
		ice on a frozen body of water. Ice fishers may fish in the open or in heated enclosures, some with bunks 
		and amenities. Ice fishing has changed drastically over the past 20 years. The name of the game 
		is mobility for today's modern ice anglers. The days of drilling hole, waiting and hoping that a fish will 
		swim by, are starting to fade. With light gear, battery-operated sonar units, and fast and powerful augers, 
		an angler can conceivably drill and check hundreds of holes in a single day. When the fish stop biting where 
		they are, anglers can move to the next hole, checking it with their sonar first to look for activity, and if 
		there are no fish they will keep moving until fish are found. In addition, schools of fish tend to move around; 
		so a hole may be productive for 10 minutes and then slow down to nothing for an hour before a school returns to 
		that location. This "fish where the fish are" technique and ease of mobility increases the catch rate of any 
		angler, because it minimizes the wait between bites, similar to "trolling" in the summer months.
		</p>
		<p>
		Anglers can now use many available maps and surveys to help pinpoint lakes and areas within those lakes that 
		make sense to try for specific fish, noting those locations in latitude and longitude coordinates. They are 
		then able to use a handheld GPS receiver to aim them to those spots, usually with accuracy of less than 20 
		feet. Ice anglers then drill holes with whichever auger they have, checking the ice thickness for safety as 
		they go. Most ice fishers advise checking that the ice is at least 4 inches thick. Using sonar, the angler 
		can determine the depth of the water, bottom content, weed and structure cover, and even see if there are fish 
		there. Also, by using sonar, they can place the bait according to where they think the fish are. If they are 
		using "tip-ups" they can carpet the area at different depths and with different presentations (the number 
		allowed being determined by local laws) and see what is the most productive. Modern ice anglers can also use 
		modern reels mounted on shorter (18"-36"/45–90 cm long) fishing rods to actively fish by watching, by using 
		their sonar, where their lure is relative to the fish, and jig accordingly to entice a bite.
		</p>
		<p>
		Ice fishing can be done at any time of day, and is typically most active around dusk and dawn. Different 
		fish are active at different times of day, so anglers need to fish for them accordingly. There are fish 
		houses large enough and comfortable enough to spend many days in a row out on the lake, fishing the entire 
		time. One can even fish in one's sleep, by using audible alarms on one's lines to tell when a fish is biting. 
		There are also many lightweight and highly mobile portable shelters that mount on plastic sleds and collapse 
		for transportation. These can vary from small, one-person shelters (commonly called "Fish Traps") to large and 
		complex shelters able to fit up to 20 people at once.

		</ul>
		<h3> Ice Thickness and Type </h3>
		<p> 
		There are many variables which dictate whether or not ice is safe to walk on, however 
		there are some widely accepted parameters. For example, newly frozen ice is always safer 
		than older ice. "Good ice" is ice which has frozen without the interruption of large temperature 
		fluctuations, rain, or snow and is clear and free of large lumps and cracks. Additionally, the
		safest ice is that which sits upon a lake without moving water. Ice on the surface of rivers
		can be extremely unpredictable.[6] Many anglers will go out with as little as 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) 
		of "good ice" for walking on. The recommended thickness of ice to support an average person is 4
		inches (10 cm), 5-6 inches (13–15 cm) for sleds (snow machines, snowmobiles) and most ATVs, 7-12
		inches (18–30 cm) for light cars, and large ATVs and a minimum of 14 inches (36–41 cm) for full-sized 
		trucks. Thinner ice in areas with swift surface currents are a significant hazard, as is ice that is 
		directly over underwater spring.
		</p>
		<h3>Hazards to Ice</h3>
		<p>
		Offshore winds can break off pans of ice which are miles wide, stranding large numbers of fishers.
		Just such a circumstance occurred in Lake Erie in February 2009, with 100 fishers having to be rescued 
		by helicopters, local authorities, and the Coast Guard. One man who had fallen into the water died on the 
		rescue flight. On March 28, 2013, as many as 220 ice anglers were trapped on break-away sea ice floes in 
		the Gulf of Riga (Latvia), necessitating a full-scale rescue operation which employed helicopters and hovercraft. 
		Many similar operations—although typically much smaller in scale—are required each year due to reckless and/or 
		inexperienced anglers. Late-winter warm spells can destroy the texture of the ice, which, while still of the 
		required thickness, will not adequately support weight. It is called "rotten ice" or soft ice and is exceedingly 
		dangerous. Some ice anglers will continue to fish, since even with the bad ice normally 8 inches (20 cm) is more 
		than enough. Ice anglers may carry a self-rescue device called an ″ice pick″ made of two spiked handles connected 
		by a string to pull themselves out of the water and onto the ice.
		</p>
		<h3> Hazards to People </h3>
		<p>
		 Many cars, trucks, SUVs, snowmobiles, and fish houses fall through the ice each year. Current environmental
		 regulations require the speedy recovery of the vehicle or structure in this situation. Divers must be hired, 
		 and when the trouble occurs far from shore, helicopters may be employed for hoisting. Other risks associated 
		 with ice fishing include carbon monoxide poisoning from fish house heaters and frostbite due to prolonged exposure
		 to wind and low temperatures, although most new houses are fitted with air exchange systems that allow air flow,
		 preventing poisoning. Although fatalities are somewhat rare, in the year of 2017, 56 people died while out on the 
		 ice in USA and Canada. Fatalities almost always occur from drowning after one has fallen into the ice, although
		 a small number of victims died from blunt-force trauma (e.g.: hitting one's head on the ice whilst falling in
		 the water).

	<h2>Different Ice Fishing Techniques</h2>
	<h3> Jig Head </h3>
	<p> 
	Three main types of fishing occur. The first is using a small, light fishing rod with small, 
	brightly coloured lures or jigs with bait such as wax worms, fat heads or crappie or shiner minnows. 
	The angler sits at the hole in the ice and lifts the pole every now and then, producing the jig effect.
	</p>
	<h3>Tip-Ups</h3>
	<p> 
	The second is using tip-ups, which are made of wood or plastic, and have a spool of line attached, 
	with a thin piece of metal that goes from the spool to the flag. Black line is put on the spool and 
	a swivel is placed at the end of the black line. Then a piece of fishing line with a hook is attached 
	to the swivel. Worms, power bait, grub worms or small minnows are placed on the hook. The hook with bait
	is placed into the water under the ice. The depth that the bait is placed goes according to several theories.
	One theory is the bait is placed one meter under the ice. The second is that the bait is placed two to three 
	metres under the ice. The third is that the bait is suspended one foot (30 cm) above the bottom of the lake.
	When the fish strikes the bait the flag is lifted which notifies the angler that a fish is on the hook. The 
	angler pulls the line in and the fish fights. The angler will allow the line to slip through their hands 
	during the struggle. Finally, when the angler can get the fish's head into the hole in the ice, the fish 
	is quickly lifted onto the ice. This allows for less-intensive fishing.
	</p>
	<h3>Spear Fishing</h3>
	<p>
	The third method is spear fishing. A large hole is cut in the ice and fish decoys may be deployed.
	The angler sits in a dark ice shanty called a dark house. The angler then peers into the water while 
	holding a large spear which has four or five points. A line can be attached to the points. The fisher 
	waits for fish to appear, then plunges the spear into the water. This method is often used for lake 
	sturgeon fishing. In the United States many states allow only rough fish to be taken while spear fishing
