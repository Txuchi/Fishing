    <h2> What is Spear Fishing? </h2>
		<p>
		Spearfishing is fishing using handheld elongated, sharp-pointed tools such as a spear, gig, or harpoon, 
		to impaling the fish in the body. It was one of the earliest fishing techniques used by mankind, and has 
		been deployed in artisanal fishing throughout the world for millennia. Early civilizations were familiar 
		with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks.
		</p>
		<p>
		Modern spearfishing usually involves the use of underwater swimming gear and slingshot-like elastic 
		spearguns or compressed gas powered pneumatic spearguns, which launch a tethered dart-like projectile to 
		strike the target fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic 
		environments and target fish. Spearfishing uses no bait and is highly selective, with no by-catch, but 
		inflicts lethal injury to the fish and thus precludes catch and release.
		</p>
		<p>
		Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling, or scuba diving techniques, but spearfishing 
		while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns 
		is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions such as New Zealand.

		<li>Boat Diving</li>

		<li>Freshwater Hunting </li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Blue Water Hunting</h3>
		<p> 
		Blue water hunting involves diving in open ocean waters for pelagic species. It involves accessing 
		usually very deep and clear water and chumming for large pelagic fish species such as marlin, tuna, 
		wahoo, or giant trevally. Blue water hunting is often conducted in drifts; the boat driver drops divers
		and allow them to drift in the current for up to several kilometres before collecting them. Blue water 
		hunters can go for hours without seeing any fish, and without any ocean structure or a visible bottom the
		divers can experience sensory deprivation and have difficulty determining the size of a solitary fish. 
		One technique to overcome this is to note the size of the fish's eye in relation to its body. 
		Large specimens have a proportionally smaller eye.
		</p>
		<h3>Freshwater Hunting</h3>
		<p>
		Many US states allow spearfishing in lakes and rivers, but most of them restrict divers to shooting only 
		rough fish such as carp, gar, bullheads, suckers, etc. Some US states do allow the taking of certain gamefish 
		such as sunfish, crappies, striped bass, catfish and walleyes. Freshwater hunters typically have to deal with 
		widely varying seasonal changes in water clarity due to flooding, algae blooms and lake turnover. Some especially
		hardy midwestern and north central scuba divers go spearfishing under the ice in the winter when water clarity
		is at its best
		</p>
		<h3>Shore Diving</h3>
		<p>
		 Shore diving is perhaps the most common form of spearfishing and simply involves entering and exiting
		 the sea from beaches or headlands and hunting around ocean structures, usually reef, but also rocks, kelp or 
		 sand. Usually shore divers hunt at depths of 5–25 metres (16–82 ft), depending on location. In some locations, 
		 divers can experience drop-offs from 5 to 40 metres (16 to 131 ft) close to the shore line. Sharks and reef fish 
		 can be abundant in these locations. In subtropical areas, sharks may be less common, but other challenges face 
		 the shore diver, such as managing entry and exit in the presence of big waves. Headlands are favoured for entry 
		 because of their proximity to deeper water, but timing is important so the diver does not get pushed onto rocks 
		 by waves. Beach entry can be safer, but more difficult due to the need to repeatedly dive through the waves until 
		 the surf line is crossed. Divers may enter from a relatively exposed headland, for convenience, then swim to a 
		 more protected part of the shore for their exit from the water.

	<h3> Speargun </h3>
	<p> 
	A speargun is an underwater fishing tool designed to launch a tethered short spear at a fish or other
	marine animal (e.g. a lobster). The most popular spearguns are elastically powered by natural latex 
	rubber bands like a slingshot, while pneumatic powered spearguns are also used, but are less powerful.
	</p>
	<h3>Buoy and Floatline</h3>
	<p> 
	A buoy is usually tethered to the spearfisher's speargun or directly to the spear. A buoy helps to
	subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish. But is more importantly used as a safety device
	to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area - usually by being large, brightly colored and flying
	a dive flag (the red flag with white diagonal stripe in the USA or the blue & white "alpha" flag
	elsewhere in the world). A typical spearo dive float will be torpedo-shaped, orange or red in colour
	with a volume of between 7 and 36 liters and display a dive flag on a short mast.
	However, other designs, such as inflatable mini-dinghy, planche (box), Tommy Botha (big game)
	and body-boards are also used.
	</p>
	<h3>Polespear</h3>
	<p>
	Polespears or hand spears consist of a long shaft with point at one end and an elastic loop at the 
	other for propulsion. They also come in a wide variety, from aluminum or titanium metal, to fiberglass 
	or carbon fiber. Often they are screwed together from smaller pieces or able to be folded down for ease 
	of transport. In 1951 Charlie Sturgill beat the competition (who were all using spearguns) with his 
	own pole spear design.
