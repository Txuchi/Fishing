    <h2> What is Commercial Fishing? </h2>
		<p>
		Commercial fishing is the activity of catching fish and other seafood for commercial profit, mostly 
		from wild fisheries. It provides a large quantity of food to many countries around the world, but those 
		who practice it as an industry must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions. 
		Large-scale commercial fishing is called industrial fishing.
		</p>
		<p>
		The major fishing industries are not only owned by major corporations but by small families as well. 
		In order to adapt to declining fish populations and increased demand, many commercial fishing operations
		have reduced the sustainability of their harvest by fishing further down the food chain. This raises 
		concern for fishery managers and researchers, who highlight how further they say that for those reasons, 
		the sustainability of the marine ecosystems could be in danger of collapsing.
		</p>
		<p>
		Commercial fishermen harvest a wide variety of animals. However, a very small number of
		species support the majority of the world's fisheries; these include herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, 
		flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last 
		four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together 
		providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species are fished in smaller numbers.

		<h2>Commercial Fishing Methods</h2>

		<li>Gillnets</li> 
		<li>Bank Fishing</li>
		<li>Longline</li>

		<li>Beam Trawl </li>

		<li>Dredgers</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Pole and Line</h3>
		<p> 
		Pole and line is a fishing method used to catch tuna and other large pelagic (midwater) species one fish at a time. 
		When a school of target fish is located, water is sprayed from the back of the fishing vessel and small bait fish (e.g. sardines) are scattered onto the surface of the water, creating the illusion of an active school of prey fish. 
		This process, known as chumming, sends the target fish into a feeding frenzy during which they will bite anything they see.
		Fishers line up along the back of the boat each with a hand-held wooden or fibreglass pole with a short line and barbless 
		hook attached. Once a fish is hooked it is flicked up and over the head of the fisher and onto the deck.
		</p>
		<h3>Netting</h3>
		<p>
		One of the most convenient forms of fish production is cage netting – the practice of farming fish for food in 
		floating cages. Cage farming can be employed by any individual who has access to a natural or artificial pond or 
		lake. The outstanding advantage of cage culture is that it permits "fish gardening" in bodies of water that aren't
		suitable for more intensive aquaculture.
		</p>
		<h3>Longline Fishing</h3>
		<p>
		Longline fishing, or longlining, is a commercial fishing angling technique that uses a long main line with
		baited hooks attached at intervals via short branch lines called snoods or gangions.[1] A snood is attached 
		to the main line using a clip or swivel, with the hook at the other end. Longlines are classified mainly by 
		where they are placed in the water column. This can be at the surface or at the bottom. Lines can also be set 
		by means of an anchor, or left to drift. Hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks can hang from a single line. 
		This can lead to many deaths of different marine species (see bycatch). Longliners – fishing vessels rigged for 
		longlining – commonly target swordfish, tuna, halibut, sablefish and many other species.

	<h2>Environmental Risks</h2>
	<h3> Food Chain </h3>
	<p> 
	The oceans cover nearly two thirds of the Earth's surface, and are continuously threatened by human behaviors 
	and practices. By taking so many fish from the seas, humans have managed to remove entire links from the marine 
	food chain. This causes a chain effect, leading to an overall upset of the delicate ecological balance.
	</p>
	<p> 
	<h3> Harzardous Risk </h3>
	Fish farming is the raising of fish for food in underwater enclosures, otherwise known as aquaculture. 
	There are environmental hazards such as waste, damage to ecosystems, and negative effects on humans. 
	Because they are so densely packed together, the fecal matter that accumulates can create algal blooms,
	or deadly parasites and viruses that thrive on the filthy environment. These can infect wild fish that 
	swim near the enclosure, or whole colonies of fish if an infected farm fish escapes the enclosure.
	</p>
	<h3> Over Fishing </h3>
	<p>
	Overfishing occurs because fish are captured at a faster rate than they can reproduce. Both advanced 
	fishing technologies and increased demand for fish have resulted in overfishing. The Food and Agricultural
	Organization has reported that "about 25 percent of the world's captured fish end up thrown overboard
	because they are caught unintentionally, are illegal market species, or are of inferior quality and size"
	It should not go unnoticed that overfishing has caused more ecological extinction than any other human 
	influence on coastal ecosystems
