    <h2> What is Freshwater Fishing? </h2>
		<p>
		Freshwater fishing is the art of angling in lakes, rivers, and streams, where tranquil waters 
		teem with diverse species like bass, trout, and catfish. It's a pastime that combines skill, patience,
		and the serenity of nature. Whether you're a seasoned angler or a novice, the lure of freshwater fishing awaits. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Freshwater fishing is one of the two major fishing disciplines, the other being saltwater fishing.
		It is done in lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies of water that are generally considered to contain 
		freshwater. In other words, the water has an extremely low salt content, or no salt content at all 
		and are suitable for species of fish generally found in freshwater. in some cases, where ocean water 
		and freshwater start to mix, which is known as brackish water, there could be situations where both 
		saltwater and freshwater species of fish can be found together. This is especially true for species of 
		fish that can tolerate less salty, or more salty, conditions very well. In general it is deemed 
		freshwater fishing or saltwater fishing based on the species sought by the angler. It is conceivable 
		that both disciplines could be practiced in the same water.
		</p>
		<p>
		Most freshwater fishing is done with a pole, line and hook, though these also vary widely. 
		Some prefer a close-faced reel, with a push button to release the line. Others prefer open faced reels, 
		where a bell is flipped to release line. There are also casting reels and fly fishing reels, 
		each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Nets can also be used, but some 
		jurisdictions place restrictions on taking certain freshwater species with nets.

		<h2> Different Types of Freshwater Rod Fishing</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Bank Fishing</li> 
		<li>Casting</li>
		<li>Float Tubes</li>
		<li>Fly Fishing</li>
		<li>Tenkara Fishing</li>
		<li>Rock Fishing</li>
		<li>Bottom Fishing</li>
		<li>Kayak Fishing</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Fly Fishing </h3>
		<p> Fly Fishing is the use of artificial flies as lures. These are cast with specially constructed fly rods 
		and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough cast 
		in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight 
		and colour. Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method, most renowned as a method 
		for catching trout and salmon, but employed today for a wide variety of species including pike, 
		bass, panfish, and carp. There is a growing population of anglers whose aim is to catch as 
		many different species as possible with the fly.
		</p>
		<h3>Bottom Fishing</h3>
		<p>
		Bottom Fishing is fishing the bottom of usually a body of freshwater. In the United Kingdom it is called "ledgering". 
		A common rig for fishing on the bottom is a weight tied to the end of the line, with a hook 
		about an inch up line from the weight. The method can be used both with hand lines and rods. 
		There are fishing rods specialized for bottom fishing, called "donkas". The weight is used 
		to cast or throw the line an appropriate distance. Bottom fishing can be done both from boats 
		and from the land. It targets groundfish such as sucker fish, bream, catfish, and crappie.
		</p>
		<h3> Casting </h3>
		<p>
		 Casting is the act of throwing the fishing line out over the water using a flexible fishing rod.
		 The usual technique is for the angler to quickly flick the rod from behind toward the water.
		 Casting is also a sport adjunct to fishing, much as shooting is to hunting. The sport is
		 supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation, which sponsors tournaments and 
		 recognizes world records for accuracy and distance.In Formula Two, Honda engines dominated 
		 the premier series in 1966 and scored multiple titles in the early 1980s.

	<h3>Freshwater Commercial Fishing</h3>
	<p> 
	It begins with the cold clear waters of Canada’s most pristine lakes. In a tradition 
	as old as the lakes themselves, fishers rise with the sun and set out. They brave wind, 
	waves, snow, and even ice storms to reach their nets and draw in their catch; the world’s 
	finest wild-caught freshwater fish.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Carefully prepared and transported according to the strictest guidelines, 
	all fish arrive at our expansive inland facility. Every customer’s order benefits 
	from our leading-edge technology and over 50 years of experience. From careful 
	sorting to meticulous preparation to exacting packing, the handling and preparation 
	of every product is measured against the highest food safety and quality standards 
	not just in Canada, but all over the world.
	</p>
	<p>
	Healthy, wild-caught freshwater fish with exceptional taste are processed
	with uncompromised quality assurance and continuous dedication to the highest 
	standards. All fish are caught using artisanal methods by fishers who carry
	on a livelihood handed down through generations.
